It is good for when you just want a message board basically (the Junior Hangout is similar) but I  have also added the \"Social activities\" block that allows us then to add other resources -like the Extra-curricular Lounge and the policy documents, in the same way we'd add resources and activities in a regular topics or weekly format course.
