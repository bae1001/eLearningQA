When approached about sponsorship for the FARE, they were very helpful and receptive, even offering staff to come and help count the day's takings. The current bank, Commonwealth, was not helpful nor forthcoming with any financial assistance.</p>\r\n<p>•We will have to find a new Auditor. Joyce has someone in mind, will obtain a quote.</p>\r\n<p>• Motion: That the P&amp;C change all accounts from the Commonwealth Bank to equivalent accounts at St George.</p>\r\n<p>Moved by: Anthony Richards</p>\r\n<p>Seconded by: Anna Alexander Passed</p>\r\n<p>Unanimously</p>\r\n<p>• Profit &amp; Loss statement shows a profit of $17 443 so far this year. Bank Register for FARE was tabled and discussed.</p>\r\n<p>PRINCIPAL'S REPORT:</p>\r\n<p>• Roof replacement is scheduled to start work in term two. We are trying to push this back to term three.</p>\r\n<p>• There have been many helpers stepping forward for the parent reading program , but more are still needed please.</p>\r\n<p>• Belinda informed the meeting about several upcoming events, including Harmony Day, Parent-Teacher interviews, a mufti day in support of Ted Banter, the Easter hat parade and Eggventions, and Band breakfasts.</p>\r\n<p>• Interactive whiteboards were discussed again. Two rooms in particular, 56M and 34S, would suit immediate installation, with a third, 2GW for consideration. Other rooms will need major renovations to facilitate installation.</p>\r\n<p>As approved at the November  meeting, the P&amp;C will contribute $22809.60 to purchase three interactive whiteboards ($7603.20 per unit). Belinda is ready to order these, but has found that to get four at once will provide a much better deal with lower unit price. • Motion: If the cost of a fourth smartboard is equal to or less than $7603.20 then the P&amp;C will fund a fourth.</p>\r\n<p>Moved by: Anna Alexander</p>\r\n<p>Seconded by: Angela Bowman</p>\r\n<p>Passed Unanimously</p>\r\n<p>Note: The funding for this motion will be sourced from the building fund which is only to be used for fixtures, and does not have any spending timetable restrictions.</p>\r\n<p>GENERAL BUSINESS:</p>\r\n<p>1. Music Website The Music Committee plans to set up a .com.au domain. No one from the music committee is in attendance to direct this discussion.</p>\r\n<p>2. Air Conditioning Energy Australia have been out to the school, but their quote has not been received yet. If Frost provides air conditioning units we are looking at a cost of $32400 for six rooms. There is $17800 in the cooling fund. Eric Richards will investigate alternatives and report back to the next meeting.</p>\r\n<p>3. Senior School Shirt A parent who could not attend the meeting asked for the Senior School Shirts to be organised earlier in the year, so the students will be able to wear them for longer than just the final term. John Coates and Belinda Magee have already begun working on this.</p>\r\n<p>4. Parking  - There was lengthy discussion about the dangerous parking practices taking place around the school and possible solutions. Belinda will contact council again to ask for the assistance of rangers.</p>\r\n<p>ITEMS RAISED WITHOUT NOTICE:</p>\r\n<p>• Playground Equipment  - Alison Franklin had a question about the supplier of the equipment preferred by the pre-school. It was proposed that we make a start on acquiring this by purchasing the first module only. A check of previous minutes showed the cost of just the first unit is still prohibitively expensive.</p>\r\n<p>• Netball/Basketball court surface -  A parent unable to attend tonight asked that this be raised, as the surfaces look worn, cracked and unsightly. Belinda informed the meeting that softfall has been put in with markings and a new centre pole.  The software purchased with the computer, it turns out, is Retail Basic, not Retail Manager. There is, however, enough money left over from the original grant to cover the upgrade mostly - we would still have to contribute approx $641.</p>\r\n<p>• Morning duty teacher -  Scott Franklin has asked whether there is a way to identify the morning teacher on playground duty, ie a lanyard or fluoro vest. Anna will approach the teachers about this. • Dogs There have been incidents in which dogs tied up outside the fence, on the footpath, have nearly harmed children walking past. As this is not on school property, the school has no control over it, however Anna  will mention it in the next school newsletter.</p>\r\n<p>• Chocolate error-  It has been realised that one person paid for their chocolates twice by mistake. The meeting agreed that this person should be reimbursed.</p>\r\n<p>MEETING CLOSED</p>\r\n<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE ANY INACCURACIES VIA REPLY BELOW.</strong> THANK YOU</p><p><br /></p>","messageformat":1,"author":{"id":43,"fullname":"Angela Bowman","isdeleted":false,"groups":[],"urls":{"image":null,"profile":"https://school.moodledemo.net/user/view.php?id=43&course=27","profileimage":"https://school.moodledemo.net/pluginfile.php/275/user/icon/boost/f1?rev=1","view":null,"viewisolated":null,"viewparent":null,"edit":null,"delete":null,"split":null,"reply":null,"export":null,"markasread":null,"markasunread":null,"discuss":null}},"discussionid":66,"hasparent":false,"parentid":0,"timecreated":1400096407,"timemodified":1403257291,"unread":null,"isdeleted":false,"isprivatereply":false,"haswordcount":false,"wordcount":null,"charcount":null,"capabilities":{"view":true,"edit":true,"delete":true,"split":false,"reply":true,"selfenrol":false,"export":false,"controlreadstatus":false,"canreplyprivately":true},"urls":{"image":null,"profile":null,"profileimage":null,"view":"https://school.moodledemo.net/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=66#p176","viewisolated":"https://school.moodledemo.net/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=66&parent=176","viewparent":null,"edit":"https://school.moodledemo.net/mod/forum/post.php?edit=176","delete":"https://school.moodledemo.net/mod/forum/post.php?delete=176","split":null,"reply":"https://school.moodledemo.net/mod/forum/post.php?reply=176#mformforum","export":null,"markasread":null,"markasunread":null,"discuss":"https://school.moodledemo.net/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=66"},"attachments":[],"tags":[],"html":{"rating":null,"taglist":null,"authorsubheading":"by <a href=\"https://school.moodledemo.net/user/view.php?id=43&course=27\">Angela Bowman</a> - <time datetime=\"2014-05-14T20:40:07+01:00\">Wednesday, 14 May 2014, 8:40 PM</time>"}}]
