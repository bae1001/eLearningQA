## Description

eLearningQA is a web app that uses Moodle's web service 
API to retrieve information and runs a set of checks
while applying an e-learning quality framework to
assess the quality of instructional design on 
Moodle courses (I am not a Moodle Partner). 
This app is intended to be used by 
teachers using Moodle.
